  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p style="text-align: left;">
	The public keyserver running on keys.openpgp.org processes, stores and
	distributes OpenPGP key data. The specific way in which data is processed
	differs by type as follows:
	<ul>
		<li><i class="fa fa-key"></i> <b>Public Key Data</b>
			<p>The cryptographic content of OpenPGP keys is not considered personally
				identifiable information. This includes specifically <abbr
					title="Packet Tags 6 and 14">public key material</abbr>,
				<abbr title="Packet Tag 2">self-signatures</abbr>, and <abbr
					title="Packet Tag 2">revocation signatures</abbr>.
			<p>This OpenPGP keys
			<p>This data is not usually collectively available, but may be handed
				upon request to third parties for purposes of development or research.
		<li><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> <b>E-Mail Addresses</b>
			<p>E-Mail addresses contained in <abbr title="Packet Tag 13">User
					IDs</abbr> are personally identifiable information. Special care is
				taken to make sure they are used only with consent:
				<ul>
					<li>Publishing requires <a target="_blank"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-in_email#Confirmed_opt-in_(COI)_/_Double_opt-in_(DOI)">double
							opt-in</a> validation, to prove ownership of the address.
					<li>Addresses are searchable by exact E-Mail address, but not by
						associated name.
					<li>Enumeration of addresses is not possible.
					<li>Deletion of addresses is possible via simple proof of ownership in
						an automated fashion, similar to publication. To unlist an address
						where this isn't possible, write to support at keys dot openpgp dot
						org.
				</ul>

				<p>This data is never handed to third parties.
		<li><i class="fa fa-user"></i> <b>Other User ID data</b>
			<p>Personal data types other than E-Mail addresses, such as <abbr
					title="Packet Tag 2">User IDs</abbr> that do not contain E-Mail
				addresses, or <abbr title="Packet Tag 17">image attributes</abbr>, are
				stripped during upload, and never stored or further processed in any
				way.
			<p>OpenPGP packet types that were not specifically mentioned above are
				stripped during upload, and never stored or further processed in any
				way.
	</ul>
	<p style="text-align: left">Data is never relayed to third parties outside of
		what is available from the public API interfaces, and what is described in
		this policy.
