      <a href="/about/news#2019-06-12-launch">Launching a new keyserver! 🚀</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
    From a community effort by <a>Enigmail</a>, <a>OpenKeychain</a>, and
    <a>Sequoia PGP</a>, we are pleased to announce the launch of the new public
    OpenPGP keyserver <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>! Hurray! 🎉

    <h4>Give me the short story!</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Fast and reliable. No wait times, no downtimes, no inconsistencies.</li>
      <li>Precise. Searches return only a single key, which allows for easy key discovery.</li>
      <li>Validating. Identities are only published with consent,
        while non-identity information is freely distributed.</li>
      <li>Deletable. Users can delete personal information with a simple e-mail confirmation.</li>
      <li>Built on Rust, powered by <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org" target="_blank">Sequoia PGP</a> - free and open source, running AGPLv3.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why a new keyserver?</h4>

    <p>
      We created <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>
      to provide an alternative to the SKS Keyserver pool,
      which is the default in many applications today.
      This distributed network of keyservers has been struggling with
      <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@mdrahony/are-sks-keyservers-safe-do-we-need-them-7056b495101c">abuse</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_server_(cryptographic)#Problems_with_keyservers">performance</a>,
      as well as <a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/12/10/1">privacy issues</a>,
      and more recently also
      <a target="_blank" href="http://nongnu.13855.n7.nabble.com/SKS-apocalypse-mitigation-td228252.html">GDPR</a>
      compliance questions.
      Kristian Fiskerstrand has done a stellar job maintaining the pool for
      <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.sumptuouscapital.com/2016/12/10-year-anniversary-for-sks-keyservers-net/">more than ten years</a>,
      but at this point development activity seems to have
      <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/pull-requests/60/clean-build-with-405">mostly ceased</a>.

    <p>
    We thought it time to consider a fresh approach to solve these problems.

    <h4>Identity and non-identity information</h4>

    <p>
    The <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span> keyserver splits up
    identity and non-identity information in keys.
    You can find more details on our <a href="/about" target="_blank">about page</a>:
    The gist is that non-identity information (keys, revocations, and so on)
    is freely distributed,
    while identity information
    is only distributed with consent
    that can also be revoked at any time.

    <p>
    If a new key is verified some e-mail address,
    it will replace the previous one.
    This way,
    every e-mail address is only associated with a single key at most.
    It can also be removed from the listing
    at any time by its owner.
    This is very useful for key discovery:
    if a search by e-mail address returns a key,
    it means this is the single key
    that is currently valid for the searched e-mail address.

    <h4>Support in Enigmail and OpenKeychain</h4>

    <p>
    The <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span> keysever
    will receive first-party support in upcoming releases of
    <a href="https://enigmail.net" target="_blank">Enigmail</a> for Thunderbird,
    as well as
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain&hl=en">OpenKeychain</a> on Android.
    This means users of those implementations will
    benefit from the faster response times,
    and improved key discovery by e-mail address.
    We hope that this will also give us some momentum
    to build this project into a bigger community effort.

    <h4>Current challenges</h4>

    <p>
    Privacy-preserving techniques in keyservers are still new,
    and sadly there are still a few compatibility issues
    caused by splitting out identity information.

    <p>
    In particular, when GnuPG (as of version 2.2.13) encounters
    an OpenPGP key without identities,
    it throws an error "no user ID"
    and does not process new non-identity information
    (like revocation certificates)
    even if it is cryptographically valid.
    We are actively engaged in
    providing fixes for these issues.

    <h4>The Future</h4>

    <p>
    Privacy-preserving techniques in keyservers are still new,
    and we have more ideas for reducing the metadata.

    <p>
    But for now, our plan is only to
    keep <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span> reliable and fast 🐇,
    fix any upcoming bugs 🐞,
    and listen to feedback from the community. 👂
    For more info, head on over to
    our <a target="_blank" href="/about">about page</a>,
    <a target="_blank" href="/usage">usage instructions</a>
    and <a target="_blank" href="/about/faq">FAQ</a> pages.
    There is more cool stuff to discover,
    like our <a target="_blank" href="/about/api">API</a>,
    and an <a target="_blank" href="/about/faq#tor">Onion Service</a>!

    <p>
    Cheers! 🍻
