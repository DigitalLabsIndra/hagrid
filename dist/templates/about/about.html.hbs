    <p>
        The <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> server is a public service for the
        distribution and discovery of OpenPGP-compatible keys, commonly
        referred to as a "keyserver".
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>For instructions, see our <a href="/about/usage">usage guide</a>.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>How it works</h3>

    <p>
        OpenPGP keys contain two types of information:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cryptographic metadata</strong> is all the technical
            information about the key itself, such as its expiry date, whether
            it is revoked or not, or how it can be used for encryption.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Identity information</strong> includes the parts of
            a key that identify its owner (known as "User IDs"), in
            particular e-mail addresses.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Traditionally, these pieces of information have always been distributed
        together. On <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>, they are
        treated differently:
    </p>

    <p>
        The cryptographic metadata of keys can be freely up- and downloaded on
        <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>.  It consists of technical
        information only, which can't be used to identify its owner. It is
        important for OpenPGP software to keep this information up to date, in
        order to maintain secure and reliable communication.
    </p>

    <p>
        The identity information in an OpenPGP key is only distributed with
        consent. It contains personal data, and is not strictly necessary for
        a key to be used for encryption or signature verification. Once the
        owner gives consent by verifying their e-mail address, the key can then
        be found by others in a search by address.
    </p>

    <h3>Community and platform</h3>

    <p>
        This service is run as a community effort. You can talk to us in
        ##hagrid on Freenode IRC, also reachable as #hagrid:stratum0.org on
        Matrix. The folks who are running this come from various projects in the
        OpenPGP ecosystem including Sequoia-PGP, OpenKeychain, and Enigmail.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technically, <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> runs on the
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/hagrid" target="_blank">Hagrid</a>
        keyserver software, which is based on
        <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org">Sequoia-PGP</a>.  We are hosted on the
        <a href="https://eclips.is" target="_blank">eclips.is</a> platform,
        a hosting provider focused on Internet Freedom projects, run by
        <a href="https://greenhost.net/" target="_blank">Greenhost</a>.
