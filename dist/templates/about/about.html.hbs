    <p>
        The <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> website is a public service for the
        distribution and discovery of OpenPGP-compatible keys, commonly
        referred to as a "keyserver".
    </p>

    <p>
        As a user, <tt>hkps://keys.openpgp.org</tt> can be used as a drop-in
        replacement for other keyservers, offering fast and reliable response
        times. All typical workflows for key updates and discovery by e-mail
        address are supported. Keys which are discoverable by e-mail must be
        verified by their owner, and can also be deleted by them. See below for
        details.
    </p>

    <p>
        This service is run as a community effort. You can talk to us in #hagrid
        on Freenode IRC, also reachable as #hagrid:stratum0.org on Matrix. The
        folks who made this come from various projects in the OpenPGP ecosystem
        including Sequoia-PGP, OpenKeychain, and Enigmail.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technically, <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> runs on the
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/hagrid" target="_blank">Hagrid</a>
        keyserver software, which is based on
        <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org">Sequoia-PGP</a>.  We are hosted on the
        <a href="https://eclips.is" target="_blank">eclips.is</a> platform,
        a hosting provider focused on Internet Freedom projects, run by
        <a href="https://greenhost.net/" target="_blank">Greenhost</a>.

    <center><h3>Goals</h3></center>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Fast and reliable key distribution</b>
            <p>The primary function of <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> is the
                distribution of updates for OpenPGP public keys. Keys can be
                uploaded by anyone, and can then be retrieved by fingerprint.
                This allows OpenPGP clients to update keys they already know, in
                particular revocations and new subkeys.
            </p>
            <p>Keys can also be discovered by e-mail, if published by their
                owner (see below).</p>
            <p>We make it a priority to keep the service fast and reliable.</p>
        </li>

        <li><b>Key discovery by e-mail address</b>
            <p>Users can choose to make a key discoverable for a specific e-mail
                address. In order to protect the privacy of our users and
                improve the usefulness of the service, some limitations apply:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Only the owner of an e-mail address can make its key discoverable.</li>
                <li>Only a single key can be associated with an e-mail address at any one time.</li>
                <li>Search is only possible by exact e-mail addresses, not by name or a partial address.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Making a key discoverable for an e-mail address requires simple
                validation, to prove ownership of the e-mail address.  A key
                published in this way can be <a href="/manage">deleted</a>
                by the owner at any time.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li><b>Preserve user privacy</b>
            <p>One of our top priorities is user privacy:
                <ul>
                    <li>We are hosted on
                        <a href="https://eclips.is" target="_blank">eclips.is</a>,
                        a hosting provider specifically created to host and
                        support Internet Freedom efforts. No Cloudflare
                        involved.</li>
                    <li>We keep no detailed access logs, only basic operational
                        usage statistics.</li>
                    <li>The service can be accessed as a TOR hidden service
                        (coming SOON).</li>
                    <li>In the future, we hope to use this platform to
                        experiment with new mechanisms that improve user
                        privacy in the OpenPGP ecosystem.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>See our <a href="/about/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more details on
                how we store and distribute data.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <center><h3>Non-Goals</h3></center>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Do not distribute spam</b>
            <p>Unlike traditional keyservers, <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> will
                never distribute key material that isn't cryptographically
                verified. This protects keys from unwanted spam, and helps
                protect the service itself against "denial of service" attacks.
            </p>
            <p>We also do not distribute "third-party" signatures on keys. These
                kinds of signatures were typically used to "sign" the keys of
                others, in order to support a "Web of Trust" trust model. This
                model as implemented proved ineffective in practice for various
                reasons, in particular it allowed attaching arbitrary spam to
                any key.
            </p>
            <p>We are open to alternative approaches that might be implemented
                in the future, that avoid this issue.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Not part of the "synchronizing keyserver" (SKS) pool</b>
            <p>The federation model of the SKS pool led to various problems in
                practice, which are incompatible with the goals stated above.
            </p>
            <p>We are not opposed to exploring other options for federation in
                the future, but it is not a high priority goal for now.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Not a de-facto certification authority</b>
            <p>While <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> can be used to discover keys
                for given e-mail addresses <i>reliably</i>, that does not mean
                they are <i>trustworthy</i> in a cryptographic sense.
            </p>
            <p>Basic validation of e-mail addresses is used to ensure keys are
                searchable by e-mail address only with consent of its owner.  We
                do not sign keys, or perform any other kind of certification.
            </p>
            <p>That said, we will do what we can to make sure this service is as
                reliable and as trustworthy as possible.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
